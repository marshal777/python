# Variable Names
john = 25  # john's age is 25 years old

# A variable can have a short name (like x and y) or a more descriptive name (age, carname, total_volume). Rules for Python variables:
a = 5
carname = "pourchasr"

# A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character.
# A variable name cannot start with a number

#2my_name = "luna" # is an error

# A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
Z = 1  
z = 1   # Variable names are case-sensitive (myvar and MyVar are two different variables)

# Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age, and AGE are three different variables).
mycat = "Luna"  # This is valid because "mycat" does not conflict with any Python keyword or function.

# A variable name cannot be any of the Python keywords.
print("Hello World")  # This is correct because "print" is a command in Python for outputting text to the console.

# Incorrect example
# Print("Hello World")  # This is incorrect because "Print" with an uppercase "P" is not recognized as a command in Python.

# Correct example
print("Hello World")  # This is correct because "print" is a recognized function in Python.
